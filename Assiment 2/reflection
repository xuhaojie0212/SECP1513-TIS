Participating in the PPG Industry Talk was an eye-opening experience that bridged the gap between my academic studies at UTM and real-world industrial practices.
As a Computer Science student, I was particularly impressed by PPG’s multi-cloud infrastructure and their use of massive data analytics tools like Databricks and Spark.
This session helped me realize that beyond technical coding, the ability to manage global-scale systems and navigate cross-cultural collaboration is crucial for a future IT professional.
It has further solidified my interest in pursuing a career in network security and systems, as I now better understand the complexity and importance of maintaining a secure, high-performance digital environment in a global enterprise."
